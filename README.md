# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website created for the Odin Project to study the basics of HTML and Git. The website consists of a main index page which links to a few recipes. Each link leads to a separate page with an image, description of the dish, ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions on how to cook.

###Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

    *The main page is index.html which lists all the recipes available.
    *Each recipe has its own HTML page under the recipes/ directory.

###How to Use

    Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the main page.
    Click on a recipe link to view the detailed recipe page.
